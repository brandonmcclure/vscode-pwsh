I welcome pull requests, but this project is my own personal snippets.

## How to build

you will need `git` and `make`, `docker` and `pwsh core` to run these build steps.

`git clone https://github.com/brandonmcclure/vscode-pwsh.git`
`cd vscode-pwsh`

Adjust the version in the Makefile, then
`make build package`
which will produce a `.vsix` you can install to test/distribute as you see fit.
